# Decisions

Decisions taken during a run where asking was not an option, one line each, with
the date and the reason. A decision that changed a file names the commit that
carries it. This file is a record, not a policy: what it says was true when it was
written, and a decision that is later reversed gets a new line rather than an edit.

- An untracked directory holding this run's own prompt file was moved out of the
  repository rather than committed or deleted. It is not repository content, every
  commit of this run has to leave the tree clean, and destroying a file somebody
  else put there is not this run's business, so it was moved to the session's
  scratchpad instead.
